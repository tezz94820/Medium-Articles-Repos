## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how applications like WhatsApp show you a thumbnail, title, and description for a shared link? ðŸ¤” This project explores the magic behind link previews by scraping metadata from web pages and serving it efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Redis**: For caching metadata and improving performance.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- **Cheerio**: A fast and flexible library for parsing HTML and extracting data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
3. **Start the Redis server**: Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    docker-compose up -d
4. **Run the Node.js server**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
## Usage

To get a link preview, make a GET request to the /link-preview endpoint with the URL you want to scrape as a query parameter. For example:
    ```bash
    GET http://localhost:3000/link-preview?url=https://www.example.com

**Example Request**
Using Postman or your browser, enter the following URL:
   ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/link-preview?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
   
## Usage

1. **Without Caching** : The request takes approximately 6.7 seconds to return metadata.
2. **With Caching** : The same request completes in just 10 milliseconds! ðŸš€
